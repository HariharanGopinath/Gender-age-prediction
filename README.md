# Gender-age-prediction-using the deep learning model

In this project, I will discuss an interesting application of Deep Learning applied to faces. I will estimate the age and figure out the gender from a single image or from live video detection.

I have divided this project into 2 models. In the model 1, I have predicted the age and gender of a person through a object detection method either through a live camera or a photo. In the model 2, I have performed a prediction model through a general deep learning model where we can predict only gender with photos.

## Model 1
The model is trained by \url{https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR}{Gil Levi and Tal Hassner}.
